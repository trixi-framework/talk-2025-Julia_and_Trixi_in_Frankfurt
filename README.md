This repository contains some material introducting the programming language
[Julia](https://julialang.org) and the Julia package
[Trixi.jl](https://github.com/trixi-framework/Trixi.jl), providing adaptive
numerical methods for conservation laws in Julia.

## Installing Julia

To obtain Julia, go to https://julialang.org/downloads/ and download the 
long-term support (LTS) release v1.10. We recommend to use juliaup as
described on the website.

## Introduction to Julia

The material for the brief introduction to Julia is contained in the directory
`introduction_to_julia` in this repository. It is written as a
[Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebook that can be updated
interactively. You can also see a 
[static preview online](https://trixi-framework.github.io/talk-2025-Julia_and_Trixi_in_Frankfurt/Introduction_to_Julia.html).

## Introduction to Trixi.jl

The material for the brief introduction to Trixi.jl is contained in the directory
`introduction_to_trixi` in this repository. It is written as a
[Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebook that can be updated

## Atmospheric applications

The material for the atmospheric applications is contained in the directory
`atmospheric_applications` in this repository. It is written as a
[Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) notebook that can be updated
interactively. You can also see a 
[static preview online](https://trixi-framework.github.io/talk-2025-Julia_and_Trixi_in_Frankfurt/atmospheric_applications.html). 
In addition to the notebook, the repository also includes example code for atmospheric applications.
